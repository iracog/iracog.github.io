            <h3>The BEST Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
            <br>
            I have been deeply invested in creating the best chocolate chip 
            cookie recipe for over 6 YEARS. And i’m thrilled to say, it is 
            *finally* absolute perfection. These are the best homemade chocolate 
            chip cookies, period. Here’s what makes them so great:
        </p>
        <ol>
           <li> They will work EVERY SINGLE TIME you bake them. There are no failed
            attempts here. If you follow this recipe, you can guarantee you will 
            be eating on of the best cookies of your life in a matter of minutes.
            </li>
            <li>The flavor does NOT quit. And I’ll tell you the secret reason 
                why. These cookies are vanilla-forward. So much so that you 
                might think there is a typo in the recipe. It’s not a typo – the 
                vanilla really pulls out all of the flavor of the brown sugar, 
                butter, egg, chocolate chips, etc and makes these the best 
                chocolate chip cookies.
            </li>
            <li> They will stay soft and chewy! IMO, these have the best texture 
                of any chocolate chip cookie ever and they will still have that 
                texture the next day. These won’t turn into dry bricks and 
                disappointment when they cool.
            </li>
            <li>This recipe makes the perfect amount. You’ll end up with a lot 
                of cookies, but not too much. It’s a win-win.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, they freeze exquisitely well (both baked and as dough!) 
                Which means you can essentially have an instant delightful 
                cookie whenever the fancy strikes. Which, trust me, once you eat 
                these homemade chocolate chip cookies will be all the time.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><h3>Best Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe Ingredients</h3></p>
            <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Salted butter, softened</b> – I use salted butter, if using unsalted 
                butter add an extra pinch or two of salt to the cookie dough.
            </li>
            <li><b>Granulated sugar</b></li>
            <li><b>Brown sugar</b></li>
            <li><b>Egg</b></li>
            <li><b>Vanilla extract</b> – No, that isn’t a typo for the vanilla. These 
                are a vanilla forward cookie and it makes them my FAVORITE ever.
            </li>
            <li>All-purpose flour – Just regular all-purpose flour works great
            </li>
            <li><b>Baking soda</b></li>
            <li><b>Salt</b></li>
            <li>
                <b>Favorite chocolate chips</b> – Use whatever chocolate chips are your 
                favorite or what you have on hand. You can even chop up a 
                chocolate bar and use it in this recipe. I like ghirardelli 
                chocolate chips for these!
            </li>
        </ul>

            <p><b><h2>Toppings</h2></b></p>
        <p>You want all of your toppings ready to go to assemble the hamburgers 
            when the patties are hot and ready. Toast the buns and prepare 
            toppings first, then cook burger patties. When building a perfect 
            burger, pick toppings that will add appealing texture, color, and 
            flavor.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sliced cheese (our favorite is thick-sliced, medium cheddar)</li>
            <li>Dill pickle slices</li>
            <li>Fresh red onions (or caramelized onions)</li>
            <li>Tomato,</li>
            <li>Green leaf or iceberg lettuce,</li>
            <li>Avocado</li>
            <li>Bacon + pineapple + the BBQ sauce below</li>
            <li>Jalapeños to add some heat</li>
        </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><h2>Instructions</h2></p>
            <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice, and prepare all of your burger toppings and sauces.</li>
            <li>Spread the cut-side of the bun with softened or melted butter 
                and toast the cut side on a skillet or on the grill until golden
                brown. You can toast the bun ahead or in the last couple of 
                minutes with the burgers on the grill. Toasting the bun adds 
                great flavor and prevents a soggy bun.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat grill to medium heat. Divide ground beef into 4 portions 
                and form patties that are about 1/2" thick and 1" wider than the 
                burger buns. Season patties generously with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li> Grill hamburger patties (indent-side-up) covered for 3-5 min 
                each side on the grill. Flip burgers when juices are accumulating 
                on top of the burger and you have a good sear. Apply cheese in 
                the last 1-2 minutes of grilling then cover with the lid and cook 
                until the internal temperature of beef reaches 160˚F.
            </li>
