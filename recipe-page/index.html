            <p>This carbonara recipe is a quick and cozy dish that's perfect for 
                any weeknight dinner. The creamy sauce, crispy beef bacon, and 
                tender pasta come together in the best way, with a pop of green 
                peas for a little extra freshness. It's simple to make but tastes 
                like you put in a lot of effort—just the kind of recipe I love 
                to share!

        <p><h2>INGREDIENTS</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces spaghetti, fettuccine, or tagliatelle</li>
            <li>2 whole eggs</li>
            <li>4 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups freshly grated parmesan</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>8 ounces beef bacon, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 to 2/3 cup pasta water (reserved from cooking the pasta)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup green peas (optional)</li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Cook the Pasta:</b> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
                Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions 
                until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water before 
                draining.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Prepare the Sauce:</b> In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg 
                yolks, freshly grated parmesan, and black pepper until smooth 
                and well combined. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cook the Bacon:</b> In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the 
                beef bacon with garlic and brown sugar until crispy, about 
                5-7 minutes. Transfer the cooked bacon to a bowl on the side, 
                leaving the bacon fat in the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Combine Bacon Fat with Egg Mixture:</b> Carefully pour the hot 
                bacon fat into the bowl with the egg and parmesan mixture, 
                whisking constantly to combine. Then, temper the egg mixture 
                by slowly adding a bit of the reserved pasta water at a time 
                until you get a creamy thick consistency, whisking to avoid 
                scrambling the eggs. Don't add all the pasta water or your 
                sauce will be too thin. You can always add more later.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Cook the Carbonara:</b> Pour the tempered egg mixture back into 
                the skillet. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly until 
                the sauce thickens and becomes creamy. Note: Stir well and 
                make sure the heat is not too high to prevent the sauce from 
                curdling.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Combine and Serve:</b> Add the cooked pasta back to the pan with 
                the sauce. Toss everything together until the pasta is well 
                coated. Then, add the cooked bacon and green peas, mixing 
                until well combined. Season with salt and additional black 
                pepper to taste. Serve immediately with extra parmesan if 
                desired. Enjoy!
