                    The English Wikipedia is the primary[a] English-language 
                    edition of Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia. It was created 
                    by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on 15 January 2001, as 
                    Wikipedia's first edition.

                    English Wikipedia is hosted alongside other language editions 
                    by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit 
                    organization. Its content is written independently of other 
                    editions[1] in various varieties of English, aiming to stay 
                    consistent within articles. Its internal newspaper is 
                    The Signpost.

                <p>
                    The English Wikipedia surpassed six million articles on 23 
                    January 2020.[12] In November 2022, the total volume of the 
                    compressed texts of its articles amounted to 20 gigabytes.[13]

                    The edition's one-billionth edit was made on 13 January 2021 
                    by Ser Amantio di Nicolao (Steven Pruitt) who as of that date 
                    is the user with the highest number of edits on the English 
                    Wikipedia, at over four million.[5] Currently, there are 
                    6,907,270 articles created with 929,134 files. The 
                    encyclopedia is home to 10.8% of articles in all Wikipedias 
                    (down from more than 50% in 2003).[14][15] The English
                    Wikipedia currently has 48,228,183 registered accounts of 
                    which 852 are administrators.

                    Editors of the English Wikipedia have pioneered some ideas 
                    as conventions, policies or features which were later 
                    adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. 
                    These ideas include "featured articles",[16] the 
                    neutral-point-of-view policy,[17] navigation templates,[18] 
                    the sorting of short "stub" articles into sub-categories,[19] 
                    dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,[20] 
                    and weekly collaborations.

                    The English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user 
                    accounts on 1 April 2007,[22] over a year since the millionth 
                    Wikipedian registered an account in February 2006.[23]

                    Over 1,100,000 editors have edited Wikipedia more than 10 
                    times.[24] Over 30,000 editors perform more than 5 edits per 
                    month, and over 3,000 perform more than 100 edits per month.[25]

                    On 1 March 2014, The Economist, in an article titled 
                    "The Future of Wikipedia", cited a trend analysis concerning 
                    data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that 
                    "[t]he number of editors for the English-language version 
                    has fallen by a third in seven years."[26] The attrition 
                    rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by 
                    The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for 
                    Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The 
                    Economist reported that the number of contributors with an 
                    average of five or more edits per month was relatively 
                    constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at 
                    approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances 
                    of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active 
                    editors in English Wikipedia, by "sharp" comparison, was 
                    cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping 
                    to 30,000 by the start of 2014.

                <p>
                    The free online encyclopedia Wikipedia has been criticized 
                    since its creation in 2001. Most of the criticism has been 
                    directed toward its content, community of established 
                    volunteer users, process, and rules. Critics have questioned 
                    its factual reliability, the readability and organization of 
                    its articles, the lack of methodical fact-checking, and its 
                    political bias. Concerns have also been raised about systemic 
                    bias along gender, racial, political, corporate, 
                    institutional, and national lines. Conflicts of interest 
                    arising from corporate campaigns to influence content have 
                    also been highlighted. Further concerns include the 
                    vandalism and partisanship facilitated by anonymous editing, 
                    clique behavior (from contributors as well as administrators 
                    and other top figures), social stratification between a 
                    guardian class and newer users, excessive rule-making, edit 
                    warring, and uneven policy application.

                    English varieties
                    A notable discussion within the English Wikipedia community 
                    concerns the preference for national variety of the English 
                    language, particularly American English and British English.[33] 
                    Various suggestions have been made, ranging from standardizing 
                    a single form of English to creating separate versions of the 
                    English Wikipedia project.[citation needed] According to a 
                    style guideline, "the English Wikipedia has no general 
                    preference for a major national variety of the language" and "
                    an article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular 
                    English-speaking nation uses the appropriate variety of 
                    English for that nation."

                    Disputed articles
                    A 2013 study from Oxford University found that the most 
                    disputed articles on the English Wikipedia tend to address 
                    broader, global issues. In contrast, articles on other 
                    language Wikipedias often focus on regional issues. This 
                    pattern is attributed to the status of English as a global 
                    lingua franca, leading to contributions from many editors 
                    for whom English is a second language. The study identified 
                    the most disputed entries on the English Wikipedia as 
                    George W. Bush, anarchism, Muhammad, list of WWE personnel, 
                    global warming, circumcision, United States, Jesus, race and 
                    intelligence, and Christianity.[
