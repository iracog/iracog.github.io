                <p>
                    Confidence on the basketball court is crucial for success. 
                    Research on confidence shows a high correlation between 
                    success on the basketball court and inner confidence. How do 
                    you get more confident?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Confidence is a word people assume comes with some level of 
                    expertise. Though we have read about confidence often, do we 
                    really understand confidence? More importantly, can we make 
                    sure our confidence is yielding the results on and off the 
                    court we want as athletes, coaches, and parents?
                </p>

                    <li>Success and confidence are strongly correlated.</li>
                    <li>Greater success increases confidence.</li>
                    <li>Confidence is measured in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors</li>
                    <li>Elite athletes who had a higher level of confidence as 
                        demonstrated in their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors 
                        had higher levels of success.</li>
                    <li>Confidence affects performance and performance affects 
                        confidence. A change in either affects the other for good 
                        or for bad. This is the confidence/performance cycle.</li>
                    <li>Athletes who have resilience can rise out of this 
                        confidence/performance cycle if it turns negative.</li>

                <h3>BASKETBALL SEASON CONFIDENCE</h3>

                    Worst case scenario: The bench has its clear pecking order. 
                    The coaches have their decided favorites. The players have 
                    their ruts, and the parents have their bitterness. 
                </p>
                    Best case scenario: The bench is alive and a real part of the 
                    team success. The coaches are building a dynasty where every 
                    player improves. The players rise above their ordinary potential 
                    and achieve together a lasting brotherhood or sisterhood of
                    power and dedication and the parents love and root for the other 
                    players on the team as much as their own children.
                <p>
                    The difference between these two contrasting scenarios lies 
                    in the thought life of each person. Thoughts influence 
                    feelings and both influence behavior. Troubled feelings that 
                    dictate thoughts will always come below the standard of 
                    excellence. Each of us must decide what we think and how we 
                    choose to feel. It is the most noble of all our human 
                    capacities...the will to choose.
